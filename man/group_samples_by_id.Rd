group_samples_by_id(samples)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{TODO
This function converts a list of Beta/Sigma samples into a more
efficient object.

Betas will be stored as a matrix with 1 row per sample and
1 column per parameter

Sigma will be stored as a k array of i by i matrices where i is the
number of visits and k is the number of samples i.e. dim = c(i,i,k)

Indexes will be a named list of vectors where the name corresponds
to the subject ID and the vector represents which rows from beta and
elements from sigma are used by that subject. (i.e. which samples did
the subject get used in) If a patient appears in a sample more than once
then that number will be duplicated in the index vector i.e. c(1,2,2,2,3,6)}
