A dataset containing data from a publicly available antidepressant clinical trial of an active drug versus placebo.
The dataset is available \href{https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/missing-data#dia-missing-data}{here}.
The relevant endpoint is the Hamilton 17-item rating scale for depression (HAMD17) which was assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6.
Study drug discontinuation occurred in 24\% subjects from the active drug and 26\% from placebo.
All data after study drug discontinuation are missing and there is a single additional intermittent missing observation.
