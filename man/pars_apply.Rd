The purpose of this function is to apply another function
across a parameters object (a list with elements mu and sigma
which are a matrix and an array respectively) in a way
such that the function being applied can interact with the inputs as
a mean vector and a single covariance matrix respectively.

That is to say, this function will loop over pars running:
fun(
list( pars1$mu\link{,i}, pars1$sigma\link{,,i}),
list( pars2$mu\link{,i}, pars2$sigma\link{,,i}),
...
)

The return type from fun() should be a list with elements mu as a vector
and sigma as a matrix.}
