\usage{
impute(draws, references, update_ice = NULL, strategies = getStrategies())
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{A draws object created by \link[rbmi]{draws}.}

\item{references}{a named vector. Identifies the references to be used when calculating the imputed
values. Should be of the form c("Group" = "Reference").}

\item{update_ice}{an optional dataframe. Updates the imputation method that was originally set via
the \code{data_ice} option in \code{draws}. See the details section for more information.}

\item{strategies}{a named list of functions. Defines the imputation functions to be used. The names
of of the list should mirror the values specified in \code{method} column of \code{data_ice}.
Default = \code{getStrategies()}. See \link[rbmi]{getStrategies} for more details.}
}
\description{
\code{impute} is used to create imputed datasets based upon the data and options specified in the
call to \link[rbmi]{draws}. One imputed dataset is created per \code{draw} "sample".
}
\details{
\code{update_ice} can be used to update the imputation method that was originally set via
the \code{data_ice} option in \code{draws}.
The \code{update_ice} dataframe must contain two columns, one for the subject ID and another for method,
whose names are the same as
those defined in \code{vars} in the call to \code{draws}. You can only update the imputation method, specifying
a visit column has no effect. If you wish to change the ICE visit date you will need to re-run \code{draws}.
A key limitation is that you can only switch between a MAR and a non-MAR method (or vice versa)
if that subject has no non-missing post ICE data.
As an example, if a subject had their ICE on "Visit 2" but still had values in the dataset for
"Visit 3" then the function will throw and error if you try to switch them from MAR to a non-MAR method or
from a non-MAR method to MAR.
