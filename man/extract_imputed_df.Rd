\usage{
extract_imputed_df(imputation, ld, delta = NULL, idmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputation}{An imputation object as generated by \code{\link[=as_imputation_list]{as_imputation_list()}}}

\item{ld}{A Longdata object as generated by \code{\link[=longDataConstructor]{longDataConstructor()}}}

\item{delta}{Either Null or a data.frame. Is used to offset outcome values in the imputed dataset}

\item{idmap}{Logical, If true attaches an attribute called "idmap" which
contains a mapping from the old subject ids to the new subject ids.}
}
\value{
A data.frame
}
\description{
Takes an imputation object as generated by \code{\link[=as_imputation_list]{as_imputation_list()}} and uses
this to extract a completed dataset from a longdata object as created
by \code{\link[=longDataConstructor]{longDataConstructor()}}. Also applies a delta transformation
if a data.frame is provided to the \code{delta} argument. See \code{\link[=analyse]{analyse()}} for
details on the structure of this data.frame.

Subject IDs in the returned dataframe are scrambled i.e. are not the original
values.
