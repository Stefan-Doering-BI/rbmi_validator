\description{
Assuming MAR, \code{draws} fits the base imputation model to the observed data
according to the given multiple imputation methodology and returns the parameter
estimates from the fit.
}
\details{
\code{draws} performs the first step of the multiple imputation (MI) procedure: the fit of the
base imputation model. The goal is to estimate the parameters of interest needed
for the imputation phase (i.e. the regression coefficients and the covariance matrices
from a MMRM model).

The function distinguishes between the following methods:
\itemize{
\item Bayesian MI based on MCMC sampling: \code{draws} returns the draws
from the posterior distribution of the parameters using a Bayesian approach based on
MCMC sampling. This method can be adopted by specifying \code{method} using \code{\link[=method_bayes]{method_bayes()}}.
\item Approximate Bayesian MI based on bootstrap: \code{draws} returns
the draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters using a Bayesian approach,
where the sampling from the posterior distribution is simulated fitting the MMRM model
on bootstrap samples of the original dataset. This method can be adopted by
specifying \code{method} through \code{\link[=method_approxbayes]{method_approxbayes()}}.
\item Conditional mean imputation with bootstrap re-sampling: \code{draws} returns the
ML/REML parameter estimates from the original dataset and from \code{n_samples} bootstrap samples.
This method can be adopted by specifying \code{method} through \code{\link[=method_condmean]{method_condmean()}} with
argument \code{type = "bootstrap"}.
\item Conditional mean imputation with Jackknife re-sampling: \code{draws} returns the
ML/REML parameter estimates from the original dataset and from the leave-one-out samples.
This method can be adopted by specifying \code{method} through \code{\link[=method_condmean]{method_condmean()}} with
argument \code{type = "jackknife"}.
}

The argument \code{data} must have one row per visit per subject. This means that incomplete
outcome data must be set as \code{NA} instead of having the related row missing. Missing values
in the covariates are not allowed. If \code{data} is incomplete
then the \code{\link[=expand_locf]{expand_locf()}} helper function can be used to add in any missing rows, using
Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation to impute the covariates values.

The argument \code{data_ice} contains information about the occurrence of ICEs. It is a
\code{data.frame} with 3 columns:
\itemize{
\item A vector of characters related to the ids of the subjects that experienced
the ICE (must be named as \code{vars$subjid}).
\item A vector of levels of \code{data[[vars$visit]]} including the first visit after the ICE (must be named as \code{vars$visit}). If
multiple ICEs happen for the same subject, then only the first non-MAR visit should be set.
\item A vector of characters related to the imputation strategy to address the ICE (must be named as \code{vars$strategy}).
Possible imputation strategies are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"MAR"}: Missing At Random.
\item \code{"JTR"}: Jump To Reference.
\item \code{"CIR"}: Copy Increments in Reference.
\item \code{"CR"}: Copy Reference.
\item \code{"JR"}: Jump to Reference.
\item \code{"LMCF"}: Last Mean Carried Forward.
\item Customized imputation strategies can also be set.
}
}

This argument is necessary at this stage since the model will be fit only on those observed data
that, if missing, would be characterized as MAR. Thus, any non-MAR observed data, i.e.
any observed data after \code{data_ice[[vars$visit]]} that is addressed with an imputation
strategy different from MAR will be discarded for the model fit. Such observed data
however will not be discarded from the data in the imputation phase
(performed with the function (\code{\link[=impute]{impute()}}).

The argument \code{vars} is a named list of key variable names to specify
the imputation model. Can be set using \code{\link[=set_vars]{set_vars()}} providing the following arguments:
\itemize{
\item \code{subjid}: column in \code{data} related to the subject ids variable.
\item \code{visit}: column in \code{data} related to the visit variable.
\item \code{outcome}: column in \code{data} related to the outcome variable.
\item \code{group}: column in \code{data} related to the group variable.
\item \code{covariates}: vector of characters related to the covariates to be included
in the model (including interactions).
By default the model specification is \code{outcome ~ 1 + visit + group}.
Please note that the \code{group*visit} interaction
is \strong{not} included in the model by default.
\item \code{strata}: covariates used as stratification variables in the bootstrap.
By default only the \code{vars$group} is used as stratification variable.
Needed only for \code{method_condmean(type = "bootstrap")} and \code{method_approxbayes()}.
\item \code{strategy}: column in \code{data_ice} related to the subject-specific imputation strategy.
